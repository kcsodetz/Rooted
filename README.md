# Rooted

Though it is very common for college students to find their home within groups or communities while they attend school, they often completely fall out of the loop and lose relevance once they graduate. Simultaneously, new members who join miss out on the opportunity to network and seek wisdom from the decade-long history of the group’s alumni.

Our app, ‘Rooted’, seeks to provide a networking platform where communities of people can keep a clean and well-documented history of all of their past members. The page will be designed to follow the structure of a tree, flowing with branches down the page that contain pictures of all alumni and links to their contact information. Such a platform provides two major benefits: the preservation of stories and accomplishments of all former members, and the creation of an expansive network for any member throughout time to reach out to for opportunities.
